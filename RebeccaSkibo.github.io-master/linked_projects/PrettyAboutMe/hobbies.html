		<h1> Hey! You found my Hobby Page!</h1>
			<p> Hello friends! This page is about my hobby that you saw on the home page of Index.html. My Hobby of gardening can be so fascinating! 
			If you think you need a backyard or a large amount of space to garden, think again! I've been gardening since I was five years old, and the first thing i ever grew on my own was a watermelon plant! 
			Now that I live in an apartment now though, i cannot garden as much as i would like, but I can still grow somethings on a smaller scale!<br> for instance, if you wanted to herbs but don't have very much space, you can take an old gallon milk jug,
			cut off the top part just bellow the bottom of the handle and then take a knife or a nail and poke holes in the bottom for drainage.</br>
			<br> Then fill with potting soil I prefer this brand <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Expert-Gardener-Potting-Mix-Potting-Soil-8-Quart/114494649" ><strong> Expert Gardener </strong> </a>, and think about an herb you would use the most. 
			I for one use parsley the most. After you pick out your plant, either buy a seed packet or if you want your plant to be a bit hardier,
			buy a seedling from your local store, such as walmart or any other store with gardening supplies! Place the seeds or seedlings in your new pot, and set by a window, making sure it gets at least six hours of sunlight a day.
			Make sure to water it whenever the soil becomes dry. 
			After a few weeks or months depending on if you got a seedling or used seeds,
			you'll have your very own parsley plant!</br></p>
