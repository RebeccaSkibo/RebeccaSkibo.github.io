				<h2>The Importance Of The Honey Bee</h2>
				<p><!-- Information courteousy of: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/plantsanimals/pollinate/?cid=stelprdb1263263-->
					One out of every three bites of food in the United States depends on honey bees 
					and other pollinators. Honey bees pollinate $15 billion worth of crops each year, 
					including more than 130 fruits and vegetables. Managed honey bees are important to 
					American agriculture because they pollinate a wide variety of crops, contributing 
					to food diversity, security and profitability.
				</p>
				<p>
					But during the past 50 years, the number of managed honey bees have declined. Each 
					winter since 2006, about 30 percent of beehives collapsed because of disease, parasites, 
					poor nutrition, pesticide exposure and other issues.
